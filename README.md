# ZenForCode Rust Course

This repository contains practice exercises and examples for learning the Rust programming language.

## Structure

Below is a description of each directory and file in this project:

- **`capstone/`**  
  Final or larger project demonstrating your understanding of Rust concepts. May include multiple modules and features.

- **`convert_temperature/`**  
  A small project or exercise to convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit using Rust. It permits
  the input output

- **`exercises/`**  
  A collection of smaller practice tasks to reinforce Rust fundamentals like ownership, borrowing, lifetimes, and more.

- **`for_loop/`**  
  Examples using `for` loops in Rust, possibly including iteration over ranges, arrays, or collections.

- **`if_cond/`**  
  Practice with conditional logic using `if`, `else if`, and `else`.

- **`intro_rust.md`**  
  A markdown document introducing Rustâ€”possibly includes installation steps, basic syntax, and learning goals.

- **`loop_break/`**  
  Demos of infinite loops and breaking out of loops in Rust using `loop`, `break`, and `continue`.

- **`min_max_mean/`**  
  A project that likely calculates minimum, maximum, and mean values from a list of numbers.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have Visual Studio Code installed, and it will create for your a DevContainer. If not:


```bash
cd rust-course
code .
```


Then navigate into a folder and run a specific project:

```bash
cd convert_temperature
cargo run
```

## Purpose

This course is designed to help beginners get comfortable with Rust by building small, focused projects and gradually increasing complexity.
